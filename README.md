# Maciej's repository
I am a PhD applicant that's experimenting with Python and R. My educational background is in Political Sciences while my professional background and interests are in Data Analysis and Data Science. This repository showcases my projects in data analysis, statistical modelling, LLMs, and data visualization. Currently I am a Data Expert at Accenture.

## Python skills
- Data manipulation with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Data visualization with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Knowledge of NLP, LLM fine tuning with Hugging Face pipelines and `transformer` models
- Data imputation with `scikit-learn`
  
## Python Projects
- [Netflix movie distribution in 1990s](https://github.com/maciohinda21/repo/blob/main/Python%20Projects/Netflix.py)
- [Std project based on SAT data](https://github.com/maciohinda21/repo/blob/main/Python%20Projects/STD_project.py)
- [Scikit-learn project based on mock product sales data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maciohinda21/repo/refs/heads/main/Python%20Projects/data_validation.py)
- [Market analysis with panda on mock data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maciohinda21/repo/refs/heads/main/Python%20Projects/market_analysis.py)
- [NLP models using Huggingface pipelines](https://huggingface.co/Maciohinda/Basic_LLM)

## R skills
- Data manipulation with `broom`, `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- Data visualization with `ggplot2`
- Regressions with `lm()` and `glm()`
- Exploratory factor analysis with `psych`

## R Projects
